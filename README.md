# Description
In software development and any other area of coding it is a common occerance to use comments for TODO and FIXME for two examples. It can be difficult with large files and/or large numbers of files to locate these comments.

whatodo is created to make locating theses comments easier. This app can read through any number of files and locate these comments returning the line number of the contents of the actual comment.

The application is written in pure Python with the help of the pygments library. With this library we are able to parse through more than 100+ languages, for a more detailed description see [pygments docs](http://pygments.org/languages/)
